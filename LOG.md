# Project Log - Frame Breaker '85

## Date: Friday, September 12, 2025

### Summary of Enhancements and Adjustments:

Today's session focused on integrating and refining the core functionalities of the Frame Breaker '85 game, particularly around blockchain interaction and game mechanics.

**1. Blockchain Integration (Wagmi & Farcaster Mini App SDK):**
*   **Multi-chain Support:** Integrated Wagmi hooks (`useAccount`, `useNetwork`, `useSwitchNetwork`) to enable multi-chain capabilities, specifically targeting Base and Base Sepolia networks.
*   **Farcaster Mini App SDK:** Initialized and utilized the Farcaster Mini App SDK for wallet connection (`sdk.wallet.getEthereumProvider`, `eth_requestAccounts`, `eth_accounts`) and chain switching (`wallet_switchEthereumChain`, `wallet_addEthereumChain`). This ensures compatibility and a smooth user experience within the Farcaster ecosystem.
*   **Score Submission to Blockchain:** Implemented `submitScoreToBlockchain` function to interact with a Solidity smart contract (`FrameBreaker.sol`). This function handles wallet connection, chain switching, gas estimation, and transaction submission for recording high scores on the blockchain.
*   **Leaderboard Enhancement:** Modified the leaderboard to display blockchain-submitted scores with a link to the transaction on BaseScan, providing transparency and verifiability.
*   **Conditional Score Saving:** Implemented logic to save scores to the blockchain if a wallet is connected via Wagmi, otherwise falling back to local storage.

**2. AI-Powered Level Generation:**
*   **Google GenAI Integration:** Utilized the Google GenAI API (`gemini-2.5-flash` model) to dynamically generate 2D array layouts for game levels. This allows for varied and creative level designs.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:** Included a fallback to a default level generation pattern in case the AI API call fails, ensuring the game remains playable.

**3. Game Mechanics & UI/UX Improvements:**
*   **Power-Ups and Power-Downs:** Introduced various power-up types (Sticky, Paint, Invincible) and power-down types (Add Bricks, Shrink Paddle) to enhance gameplay dynamics. These are randomly assigned to bricks.
*   **Dynamic Paddle Width:** Implemented logic to adjust paddle width based on power-downs.
*   **Color Picker Power-Up:** Added a "Paint Palette" power-up that allows players to clear all bricks of a selected color, introducing a strategic element.
*   **Game State Management:** Refined game state transitions (`start`, `playing`, `paused`, `level-complete`, `game-over`, `leaderboard`, `color-picker`, `respawning`) for a smoother user flow.
*   **Pause Functionality:** Added a pause/resume button and keyboard shortcut (Escape key).
*   **HUD Enhancements:** Improved the in-game HUD to clearly display score, level, and lives.
*   **Loading State:** Implemented a loading state for when new levels are being generated by the AI.
*   **Responsive Input:** Ensured paddle movement works with both mouse and touch inputs.

**4. Code Structure and Configuration:**
*   **Constants:** Centralized game configuration constants (canvas dimensions, paddle/ball/brick properties, colors, power-up chances) for easier management.
*   **Wagmi Chain Configuration:** Defined `tokenSymbols` mapping for different chain IDs to display correct native token symbols.
*   **Error Handling:** Added error handling for wallet connection, score submission, and leaderboard loading/saving.

### Next Steps:
*   Validate contract address and ABI consistency across the project.
*   Perform a comprehensive scan for redundancies and optimization opportunities.
*   Debug and identify potential problems across all files.

### Keystore Integration and Deployment Enhancements:

*   **Keystore Import Script:** Created `keystore_import.py` in the project root to securely generate encrypted keystore files from private keys.
*   **Deployment Script Restructuring:**
    *   Renamed `blockchain/scripts/deploy.s.sol` to `blockchain/scripts/DeployBase.s.sol`.
    *   Created `blockchain/scripts/DeployMonad.s.ol` for Monad-specific deployments.
    *   Updated both `DeployBase.s.ol` and `DeployMonad.s.ol` to:
        *   Accept constructor arguments for the `FrameBreaker` contract.
        *   Include commented-out sections for automatic contract verification upon deployment.
*   **`package.json` Updates:** Modified `scripts` to:
    *   Point `deploy:base` and `deploy:baseSepolia` to `DeployBase.s.ol` with `--verify -vvvv` flags.
    *   Added `deploy:monad` and `deploy:monadTestnet` pointing to `DeployMonad.s.ol` with verification flags.
    *   Introduced a new `keystore:create` command to run the Python keystore script.
*   **`foundry.toml` Configuration:** Updated RPC endpoints and Etherscan configurations to include Monad and Monad Testnet, preparing for multi-chain deployments and verification.
